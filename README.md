# 📊 Sales and Profit Analysis Dashboard (Excel Project)


## 📖 Overview

The Sales & Profit Dashboard is a dynamic Excel-based analytics tool designed to visualize key business metrics — including sales performance, profitability, and customer distribution — across multiple dimensions such as Category, Region, Year, and Month. This is a hybrid of BI design, automation scripting, and user-experience engineering. 

The project applies Descriptive Analytics and KPI Theory to summarize and measure business performance, enhanced through Data Visualization principles for effective communication. Automation and HCI theories are incorporated through VBA macros, enabling user interactivity and efficiency. Data Quality frameworks such as ETL and integrity validation ensure the accuracy of insights. Together, these theories support a data-driven decision-making process that enhances business understanding and operational performance.
